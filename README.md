"# problem-sets-dementia13" 
Pre-Jan 20: reviewing notes, trying out examples in fsi. Modifying them to see what happens. Trying:
- Tuples of tuples
- naming tuples and lists
- tuples of functions, passing tuples of functions to a function
- combining examples with built-in List functions
- trying the automatic list constructor with a string (doesn't work)
